                <td>The methodology involves the use of pre-trained LLMs combined with techniques such as few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT), and external memory. The MPC system is designed to maintain persona and engagement throughout conversations by modularizing the chatbot's components, including a clarifier, memory processor, and utterance generator.
